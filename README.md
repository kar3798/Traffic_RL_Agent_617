# Traffic Light Control with SUMO and Reinforcement Learning ðŸš¦

This project is an implementation of a Traffic Light Control system using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. The system allows for the control of traffic lights in an intersection and uses SUMO's TraCI API for real-time control.

---

## Features
- **Traffic Light Control:** Manages traffic lights at a multi-lane intersection.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** A basic random agent is used as a baseline.
- **SUMO Integration:** Uses SUMO-GUI for visualization.
- **Dynamic Route Control:** Routes can be easily defined in the configuration files.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for connection and route issues.
